# Brushstrokes

Brushstrokes is a project to convert images into simpler geometric shapes.
It has been inspired by the [work of fogleman's primitive](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive/), and has been implemented in rust.

Currently very early stages. Results ain't great. Very slow. And lots of hardcoding. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Improvements:
1. Use multiple threads.
2. Improve efficiency overall.
3. Add support for triangles, circles, etc.
4. Use multiple starting points for hill-climb.
5. Try out other optimisation algorithms.
6. Add command line arguments, and other usability improvements.
