# Qaudstrokes

Qaudstrokes is a project to simplify images by estimating average colour.
It has been inspired by the [work of fogleman's quads](https://github.com/fogleman/quads/), and has been implemented in rust.

Currently very early stages. Little slow. And lots of hardcoding. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Improvements:
1. Use multiple threads.
2. Improve efficiency overall.
3. Add command line arguments, and other usability improvements.
4. Add different shapes. (Try Uber/H3 tiling)
